# CARP Patch Archive (??)

I recently discovered that both the original home (the CU Computer Science Dept. Systems Lab TRAC server) and my earlier archive (Gitab running on my desktop at CMU) for the CARP tool were gone.

This is a longer-term / archival home for what I **hope** is the correct code bnase, re-extracted from my personal repository.  The correctness of this is IN NO WAY guaranteed

In this directory are also the original/base [MADWiFi README](./README) and the [patch README.CCA](./README.CCA)
